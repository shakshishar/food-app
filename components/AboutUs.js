                <p>Pizza's is all about quality you can trust.</p>
                <p>
                  As one of the original founding Pizza brands and the 3rd largest Pizza chain
                  in India, our sole mission is making the freshest, tastiest, and cheesiest
                  Pizza around.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our classic pan pizza will always be a fan favorite, with a soft and chewy
                  crust perfectly balancing out the healthy tomato puree and mozzarella-cheddar
                  blended cheese.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our authentic Italian crust is for those who would prefer a light and airy
                  crust to more fully enjoy the toppings. Thin, light, and delicious.
                </p>
                <p>Choose between a spicy buffalo, sweet BBQ, tangy chipotle, or creamy makhni to perfectly complement your toppings.</p>
